# WindowsBloatwareRemover - Rewrite in Rust

This is the dev branch for the rust rewrite of the Windows Bloatware Removal Tool (originally written in python)

The rewrite is in very early development and it is therefore recommended to still download the python version as an executable from the [main branch](https://github.com/J-onasJones/WindowsBloatwareRemover/tree/main)
