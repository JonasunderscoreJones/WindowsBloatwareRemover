# WindowsBloatwareRemover - python dev
This branch is basically dead. After making the decision to introduce a UI, I started working with python but quickly realised that this wouldn't work with major complications and would be a lot more work than doing it *properly* (yes, I consider python here an incovinient and ugly solution) in another language, my choice: rust.

This branch only exist because I won't pull the changes over to the master branch as the code here isn't done. 

Check out the [rust-dev branch](https://github.com/J-onasJones/WindowsBloatwareRemover/tree/rust-dev) for the progress on the rewrite.
